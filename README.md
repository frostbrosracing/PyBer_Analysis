# PyBer Analysis Based on City Type

## Project Overview of the PyBer Analysis
#### This project was completed to provide insights to the CEO of PyBer based on an analysis of ride data from the first four months of 2019.
The analysis was conducted by grouping cities according to what type of city they were.  These types were: ***urban***, ***suburban***, and ***rural***.  By classifying cities in this way, we're able to begin to see trends based on summarized data collected based on a number of factors.  

  1.  Total rides summarized by city type
  2.  Total drivers summarized by city type
  3.  Total fares summarized by city type
  4.  Average fare per ride summarized by city type
  5.  Average fare per driver summarized by city type
 
 In addition to these summarized values, a graphical visualization of the total fare revenue broken down by city type and grouped by week for the period being analyzed was rendered.
 
#### Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.9, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, Pandas 1.1.3, Numpy 1.17.0, Matplotlib 3.3.2
 
## PyBer Analysis Results
The image below shows the totals and averages for all calculated summaries in this analysis.

### 1. Total Rides by City Type
Because of the dense population of cites categorized as ***urban***, total ride volume is inherently greater in these locations than in ***suburban*** or ***rural*** areas.  As shown in the summary dataframe below, the total number of rides in ***urban*** city types is **13 times greater** than the total number of rides in ***rural*** city types. 
### 2. Total Drivers by City Type
Again, because of population density being greater in ***urban*** areas, the total number of drivers is significantly greater than in ***rural*** city types.  Here we see an increase of **30 times** the number of drivers.  
### 3. Total Fares by City Type
The total revenue generated by fares is directly related to the total number of rides.  Here we see almost **10 times** the revenue generated in ***urban*** versus ***rural*** city types.  
### 4. Average Fare per Ride by City Type
The average fare per ride is much more closely related than any of the other key metrics obtained in this analysis.  
### 5. Average Fare per Driver by City Type
Some interesting observations can be made within this summary.  Here we see that even though there is such a significantly smaller revenue total, because there are so few drivers in ***rural*** city types, the average fare per driver is much greater than in ***urban*** city types.  It's here that the following recommendations begin to take shape.

## PyBer Analysis Summary
Based on the analysis it is clear the there is an underserved community in rural city neighborhoods by drivers.  In order to balance the distribution of driver coverage to different ride areas the following recommendations should be considered:

1.	A slight decrease in the overall cost to consumers using the PyBer service in ***rural*** city types will likely increase demand in those areas.  
2.	Based on the increased demand of rides generated from the adjusted prices in rural city types, increase the driver availability in those areas by offering incentives to service that increase in demand. 
3.	Slightly increase the price per mile in more densely populated urban city types to increase the Average
