# PyBer Analysis Based on City Type

## Project Overview of the PyBer Analysis
#### This project was completed to provide insights to the CEO of PyBer based on an analysis of ride data from the first four months of 2019.

Unserved neighborhoods.


In order for key personnel to make strategic decisions at the school and district level, a wide range of data were collected and evaluated.  During the course of the analysis, it was discovered that there was evidence of academic dishonesty involving both the math and reading scores within a grade level at one of the high schools in the district.  Because of this, it was necessary to repeat the analysis with those suspect scores being removed from the results and the rest of the data remaining intact.  The scope of this project included the following summaries:
  1.  Total rides summarized by city type
  2.  Total drivers summarized by city type
  3.  Total fares summarized by city type
  4.  Average fare per ride summarized by city type
  5.  Average fare per driver summarized by city type
  6.  A graphical visualization of the total fare by city type by week for the period being analyzed
 
#### Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.9, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, Pandas 1.1.3, Numpy 1.17.0, Matplotlib 3.3.2
 
## PyBer Analysis Results

### 1. Total Rides by City Type
Because of the dense population of cites categorized as ***urban***, total ride volume is inherently greater in these locations than in ***suburban*** or ***rural*** areas.  As shown in the summary dataframe below, the total number of rides in ***urban*** city types is more than **10 times greater** than the total number of rides in ***rural*** city types. 

### 2. Total Drivers by City Type

### 3. Total Fares by City Type

### 4. Average Fare per Ride by City Type

### 5. Average Fare per Driver by City Type


## PyBer Analysis Summary
Based on the analysis it is clear the there is an underserved community in rural city neighborhoods by drivers.  In order to balance the distribution of driver coverage to different ride areas the following recommendations should be considered:

1.	Slightly lower the price per mile in less densely populated rural city types to increase overall ride volume.  
2.	Based on the increased demand of rides generated from the adjusted prices in rural city types, increase the driver availability in those areas by offering incentives to service that increase in demand. 
3.	Slightly increase the price per mile in more densely populated urban city types to increase the Average
